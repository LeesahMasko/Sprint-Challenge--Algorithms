#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)Runtime complexity is O(n) linear. This is similar to a for loop.


b)Runtime complexity is O(n log n), Quasilinear time.  The outer loop increments by one(linear O(n)), but the value of the inner loop is doubling each time it runs.(O(log(n)))


c)Runtime complexity is O(n), linear time.  Bunnies are decremented by 1 each time this runs for 'n' times.

## Exercise II
In this case it might be best to use the binary search. Where we can start with the mid point, if an egg breaks from the mid point, we would then go to the next midpoint and continue that process until we find the floor where an egg dropped does not break, but the floor just above does cause the egg to break.
